    <h3 id="About">About me</h3>
  <p class= "P1">I take part in extracurricular activities where I get to improve my knowledge in differnet coding languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript etc. It's a fun and valuable experience to learn about making websites, games and creating different types of apps that i can use dailly. In addition, I joined girls golf team the fall semester and it was a exciting to join because I have never been on a sports team before. I got to practice at Dyker beach golf course and Marine park golf course during my time on that team and i gained a lot of new knowledge about golf and how to play it correctly. I chose not to join the golf team in the spring semester because i felt like i didn't have enough time to be able to fully immerse myself in golf but i plan to join again next year. My hobbies include playing the piano, crocheting and playing tennis</p>
